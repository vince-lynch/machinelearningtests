A Machine Learning demonstration I made in ConvNetJS (Deep Q Learning in the browser)

Notes: The Black Ball is controlled by the Intelligent Q Learner, its rewarded when it eats the GREEN food, and punished when it consumes the Grey poison. It learns after around 30,000 games. To see what it looks like after 30,000 please previous save from memory.
